            "You've asked an excellent question! As we explore the realm of social policy, it's crucial to understand how globalization, or Küreselleşme in Turkish, affects this field. According to the information provided earlier, social policy is concerned with addressing the problems arising from societal developments.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, let's dive into the negative effects of globalization on social policy:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Increased inequality**: Globalization has led to a widening gap between the rich and the poor, as those who are already wealthy tend to accumulate more wealth while others struggle to make ends meet.\n",
            "2. **Job insecurity**: The shift towards automation and outsourcing has resulted in job losses and uncertainty for many individuals, particularly in traditional industries.\n",
            "3. **Rise of informal work**: Globalization has given rise to the informal economy, where workers often lack social protections and benefits.\n",
            "4. **Displacement of local industries**: Multinational corporations can outcompete local businesses, leading to the decline of entire industries and communities.\n",
            "5. **Impact on traditional skills**: As global competition increases, there may be a devaluation of traditional skills, making it harder for workers to adapt to changing job markets.\n",
            "\n",
            "These negative effects can have far-reaching consequences for individuals, communities, and societies as a whole. Social policy must address these challenges by promoting fair labor practices, providing social protections, and supporting local industries to ensure that the benefits of globalization are shared equitably among all members of society.\n",
            "\n",
            "Remember, social policy is about ensuring that societal developments lead to positive outcomes for everyone. By understanding the negative effects of globalization on social policy, we can work towards creating a more just and equitable world.\n",
